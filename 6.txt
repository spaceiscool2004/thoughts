‘I miss you terribly sometimes, but in general I go on living with all the energy I can muster. Just as you take care of the birds and the fields every morning, every morning I wind my own spring, I give it some 36 good twists by the time I've got up, brushed my teeth, shaved, eaten breakfast, changed my clothes, left the dorm, and arrived at the university. I tell myself, "OK, let's make this day another good one"’
Getting out of bed is hard nowadays. So little to look forward to yet so much to do - a privileged dilemma, yes, but still sad. I remember back when I spoke to her, every day was like a new opportunity to love her once again. I could work through the tedious yet trivial problems of the day knowing that I had someone to love, and at the end of the day I could talk to her, and it would all be ok. Getting up and getting ready and going to classes was easy because it was all worth it. It was all worth it, for her. Of course my own selfishness and ego blinded me in the end but during our time it also made my life so much better. My ego was so connected to this juvenile love that it made me so much - better at life? I may be exaggerating or misremembering how it was. Now there is nothing that remains of that past love. In this moment I find it sad that a love which back then I found so important and central to me, is now reduced to nothing - and only I remain. I think I remember always thinking to myself back then ‘It gets better’, and I hope that's true.
