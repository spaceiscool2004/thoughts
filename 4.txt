I'm really finding it difficult to focus on what's 'important' right now. I dreamt about her last night and now I can't stop thinking about her. They say time heals all wounds but it's been a while. I feel like I will never have closure with her and it's killing me from the inside out. My habit of wishful thinking keeps getting in the way of reality, and it's really starting to cause problems now. I've been behind for a while now but I think it's really starting to catch up to me. Why can't I just get over her? I always used to think that I wanted her, but now I'm starting to believe that I need her. I'm finding it difficult to do anything of value anymore, my life just drags on but I know I can change and actually make something of my life, I know that is a very real possibility but I just don't. I've been thinking a lot about regret recently and especially the things in my life that I regret. I try not to worry about things that I have no say in but some of the mistakes that I have made in the past still burn. Is that just what the human experience is? Just drifting all you like? I think a lot of people drift through life and let their emotions guide them and I don't want to be one of those people but I think I'm becoming one of those people. My life right now feels kind of placid and it feels like I'm missing something. I have brief periods of motivation and hope but otherwise just flatness. I wish I had someone to talk to
